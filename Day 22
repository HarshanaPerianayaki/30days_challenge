               Cost: Recommendations to reduce unnecessary spending.
               Security: Suggestions to improve the security posture of your resources.

          Step 1: On the Azure Advisor dashboard, you'll see a list of recommendations grouped by the above categories.
          Step 2: Click on any of the recommendations to view detailed insights. Each recommendation provides:
                    Description of the issue or improvement.
                    Impact of the issue (e.g., potential cost savings or security risk).
                    Actionable steps to resolve or improve the situation.
         Step 3: For each recommendation, you can either:
                    Take Action: Follow the recommended steps, such as resizing a virtual machine, enabling backups, or adjusting security settings.
                    Dismiss: If you donâ€™t find the recommendation relevant, you can dismiss it.

    4. Filter and Prioritize Recommendations

         You can filter the recommendations by:
             Category: Focus on one specific area, like Cost, Security, etc.
             Severity: Prioritize based on High, Medium, or Low severity.
             Resource: Filter by resource types (e.g., virtual machines, storage accounts).
             Subscription: If you manage multiple subscriptions, you can focus on a specific subscription.
         These filters allow you to tailor the recommendations to the most critical areas for your organization.

    5. Take Action on Recommendations

         For each recommendation, Azure Advisor provides the option to directly apply changes to your resources where possible. For example:
            Cost: It may recommend switching to a lower-cost VM size or removing unused resources.
            Security: It may advise enabling Azure Security Center or configuring firewalls.
            Performance: It may suggest adding more instances or configuring auto-scaling.
            Reliability: It could recommend setting up Azure Availability Zones for fault tolerance.
         Click on "Apply" or "Go to Resource" to directly take action or navigate to the resource.

        Step 1: Go to the Subscriptions tab in the Azure Advisor dashboard.
        Step 2: Select or add the subscriptions you want to review.
        This feature is particularly useful for enterprise administrators who oversee several subscriptions.

   7. Get Email Notifications for Advisor Recommendations

        You can enable notifications to get recommendations sent directly to your email, which helps ensure you don't miss out on important suggestions.
        Step 1: Go to Azure Advisor.
        Step 2: Under the Settings section, click on Notifications.
        Step 3: Enable notifications for recommendations based on your preference (e.g., for Cost, Security, etc.).
