Day 27 : Azure Sentinel !!

Here’s a step-by-step guide to set up and use Azure Sentinel in the Azure Portal:

    Step 1: Log in to the Azure Portal
            Navigate to Azure Portal.
            Sign in with your Azure account credentials.

    Step 2: Create or Use a Log Analytics Workspace
            Azure Sentinel requires a Log Analytics workspace to store and analyze data.
            In the Azure Portal, search for "Log Analytics workspaces" in the search bar.
            Click "Create".
            Fill in the following details:
                 Subscription: Select your subscription.
                 Resource Group: Create a new one or use an existing one.
                 Workspace Name: Provide a unique name.
                 Region: Choose a region close to your operations.
            Click Review + Create and then Create.

    Step 3: Enable Azure Sentinel
            In the Azure Portal, search for "Azure Sentinel" in the search bar.
            Click "Create" or "Add".
            Select your Log Analytics workspace from the dropdown.
            Click Add Azure Sentinel.

    Step 4: Connect Data Sources
            Azure Sentinel can ingest data from various sources like Azure services, on-premises environments, and third-party applications.
            In the Azure Sentinel Overview page, go to Data connectors.
            Browse available connectors (e.g., Azure Active Directory, Microsoft Defender, Office 365, or custom logs).
            Select a connector and click Open connector page.
            Follow the instructions to configure the data source:
            Authenticate to the source.
            Set permissions.
            Enable data ingestion.

    Step 5: Create and Customize Analytics Rules
            In the Azure Sentinel menu, navigate to Analytics.
            Click + Create to add a new rule.
            Choose a template or create a custom query.
            Define:
               Rule Name: Provide a meaningful name.
               Severity: Set the severity level (Informational, Low, Medium, High).
               Thresholds: Define thresholds or conditions for alerts.
            Save the rule.

    Step 6: Monitor Alerts
            Navigate to the Incidents tab in Azure Sentinel.
            View and investigate generated alerts.
            Drill down into specific incidents to analyze root causes and impacts.

    Step 7: Automate Responses (SOAR)
            Go to the Automation tab in Azure Sentinel.
            Click + Create a playbook.
            Use Azure Logic Apps to design automated workflows triggered by security incidents:
            Examples: Blocking an IP, sending notifications, isolating a device.
            Save and activate the playbook.

    Step 8: Visualize Data with Workbooks
            In the Workbooks tab, view pre-built dashboards or create custom ones.
            Use visualizations to track metrics like login attempts, suspicious activities, or threat trends.

    Step 9: Monitor Sentinel Performance
            Use Azure Monitor to keep track of Log Analytics workspace usage.
            Set up budget alerts for cost control.
            Would you like guidance on integrating Azure Sentinel with specific tools (e.g., Splunk, Palo Alto, or AWS), or configuring a custom detection rule?
