Day 16: Azure Communication Services !!

• Overview: Explain the use of communication services for sending and receiving emails or SMS.

• Hands-On Task:
        1. Set up Azure Communication Services.
        2. Create an email identity and verify it.
        3. Send a test email using the Azure portal or SDK.

**Steps to Implement Azure Communication Services:**

        **1. Set Up Azure Communication Services**
              To set up ACS and use its email capabilities, follow these steps:

                    1.Create an Azure Communication Services Resource:
                             Log in to Azure Portal: Go to Azure Portal.
                             Create a new Communication Services resource:
                             In the left sidebar, click on Create a resource.
                             In the Search box, type "Communication Services" and select Azure Communication Services.
                             Click Create and fill in the necessary details:
                                  Subscription: Select your Azure subscription.
                                  Resource group: Either create a new resource group or use an existing one.
                                  Name: Provide a unique name for your ACS resource.
                                  Region: Choose a region where the service will be hosted.
                                  Pricing tier: Choose the appropriate tier (usually the Standard tier for email/SMS).
                             Click Review + Create and then click Create to deploy the resource.

                             2.Obtain the Connection String:
                                  Once the ACS resource is created, go to your newly created ACS resource in the portal.
                                  Under Settings, click on Keys.
                                  Copy the Connection String. You’ll need this for authentication when using the SDK or REST API.

         **2. Create an Email Identity and Verify It**
                  To send emails via ACS, you need to configure an email identity (the "From" email address) and verify it.

                             1.Navigate to the Email Identity Section:
                                   In the ACS resource settings, under Settings, find and click on Email.
                                   Click on Create Email Identity.
                                   Create and Verify an Email Identity:
                                         Email address: Enter the email address you want to use for sending emails (e.g., no-reply@yourdomain.com).
                                         Verification Type: Choose whether you want to verify a Custom Domain or a Single Email Address.
                                         Single Email Address: Enter a valid email address.
                                         Custom Domain: If you want to use a custom domain, you'll need to configure domain verification via DNS (you will get instructions).
                                         Complete the Verification:
                                   If using a Single Email Address, ACS will send a verification email to that address. You will need to click the verification link in the email to confirm ownership.
                                   If using a Custom Domain, you'll need to add DNS records as specified to complete the verification.

          **3.Send a Test Email Using the Azure Portal or SDK**
                   Once the email identity is set up and verified, you can use either the Azure Portal or the SDK to send a test email.

                              1.Send Email Using the Azure Portal
                                    Go to the Email section in your ACS resource.
                                    Click on Send Test Email.
                                    Fill in the fields for the test email:
                                          To: The recipient's email address.
                                          Subject: The subject of the email (e.g., "Test Email").
                                          Body: The body of the email (e.g., "This is a test email from Azure Communication Services").
                                    Click Send to send the email.
                                    If successful, the recipient should receive the email.
