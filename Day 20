Day 20: Implement Intersite Connectivity in Azure !!

Implementing intersite connectivity in Azure allows you to securely connect multiple on-premises networks or Azure Virtual Networks (VNets) across different locations.
Here’s a step-by-step guide to set it up:

**Steps to Implement Intersite Connectivity:

     1. Site-to-Site VPN
        This method uses an IPsec/IKE tunnel.

        Create a Virtual Network and Subnet:
            In the Azure portal, go to Virtual Networks > Create.
            Define the address space and subnets.

        Deploy a Virtual Network Gateway:
            Go to Virtual Network Gateways > Create.
            Choose VPN as the gateway type and SKU based on your performance needs.

        Create a Local Network Gateway:
            Specify your on-premises network details (public IP and address space).

        Configure a VPN Connection:
            Go to the Virtual Network Gateway > Connections > Add.
            Choose Site-to-Site and provide the shared key (same as on-premises VPN).

        On-Premises Configuration:
            Set up the IPsec/IKE connection on your local router or firewall.

   2. VNet-to-VNet Connectivity
        There are two options: VNet Peering or VPN Gateway.

        Option 1: VNet Peering (Recommended for low latency)
                  Go to one VNet > Peerings > Add.
                  Configure the peering settings and repeat for the other VNet.

        Option 2: VPN Gateway
                  Deploy a VPN Gateway in each VNet.
                  Create a connection between the gateways using the IPsec/IKE protocol.

   3. ExpressRoute
        Use for high-performance, private connections.

        Set up an ExpressRoute Circuit:
             In the Azure portal, go to ExpressRoute > Create.
             Choose a service provider and specify bandwidth.

        Link VNets to ExpressRoute:
             Go to the ExpressRoute Gateway > Connections.
             Attach your VNets using Virtual Network Gateway.

  4. Hybrid Setup (VPN + ExpressRoute)
        Set up ExpressRoute for primary connectivity.
        Configure a VPN Gateway as a backup route.
