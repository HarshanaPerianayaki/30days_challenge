Here's a step-by-step guide to using Azure Managed Identity in the Azure portal:

Enable Managed Identity in Azure Portal

For System-Assigned Managed Identity:

   1.Navigate to the Azure Resource:
        Go to the Azure portal and select the resource (e.g., Virtual Machine, App Service) you want to enable Managed Identity for.

   2. Enable the Identity:
        In the resource menu, select Identity under Settings.
        Toggle the System-assigned Managed Identity switch to "On."
        Click Save.

   3.Assign Permissions:
        Go to Azure Role Assignments (or IAM) in the Azure portal.
        Assign the required roles to the Managed Identity (e.g., Reader, Contributor, or a custom role).

For User-Assigned Managed Identity:

   1.Create a User-Assigned Managed Identity:
        In the Azure portal, search for Managed Identities and select + Add.
        Configure the name, subscription, resource group, and location, then click Create.

   2.Assign the Identity to a Resource:
        Go to the Azure resource where you want to assign the identity.
        Under Identity, select User-assigned and click + Add.
        Select the Managed Identity you created and click Add.

   3.Assign Permissions:
        Similar to system-assigned identities, assign the appropriate roles to this Managed Identity.

Use Managed Identity to Authenticate
   1.Access Azure Services:
        Use the identity to access supported Azure services like Key Vault, Storage Accounts, or SQL Database without managing secrets.

   2.Azure SDK Support:
        Azure SDKs and tools like REST API, Azure CLI, or PowerShell can authenticate using the Managed Identity.
